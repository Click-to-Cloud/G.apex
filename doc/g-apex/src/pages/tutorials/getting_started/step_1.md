## {$page.title}

G.apex has a dependency on [R.apex](https://github.com/Click-to-Cloud/R.apex).

First, we will include R.apex.

Include **Func.cls**, **R.cls**, and **RTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and R.apex is ready.

Then, we will include G.apex.

Include **G.cls**, and **GTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and you are ready to go.

If you want to use Query Editor, include **GDemoController.cls**, and **GDemo** lightning component into your Org.
